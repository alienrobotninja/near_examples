# jimmy_test

Write a simple API wrapper for NEAR's  testnet API in Rust. You should then build a wallet using the API you built. The wallet should have it's own account creation page, before offering users the option to import their NEAR testnet wallets.

You should write tests for both the API and the wallet. You should also include setup instructions for both the API and the app.
